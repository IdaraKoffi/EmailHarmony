EmailHarmony Project
This project is a web application called EmailHarmony, designed to provide users with a seamless email management experience. EmailHarmony allows users to manage multiple email accounts, synchronize emails and calendars across devices, and access their emails from anywhere.

My Inspiration Story
John had always struggled with managing multiple email accounts for work, personal, and various projects. He found it frustrating to switch between different interfaces, leading to missed appointments and deadlines. One day, while discussing this pain point with his friend Emily, a brilliant backend developer, they decided to tackle this problem head-on. Inspired by their own experiences and the desire to simplify email management for others, they embarked on the journey of creating EmailHarmony.
